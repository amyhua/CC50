			ephemeraDescription: `### An Interview with Guy Maddin

> In April 2018, Canyon Cinema invited Guy Maddin to curate an evening of films from our collection for the 60th San Francisco International Film Festival. Maddin presented *The Great Blondino and Other Delights*, featuring work by Robert Nelson and William Wiley, Abigail Child, Daina Krumins, and Gary Goldberg. Though he was not able to attend in person, we used ritual magick to summon his spirit for an interview. 
 
Antonella Bonfanti: The centerpiece of this evening’s program is *The Great Blondino* (1967), a collaborative work between artists William T Wiley and Robert Nelson, both of whom were central figures in the art, film and performance communities in the Bay Area throughout the 1960s and beyond. Tomorrow evening you will be premiering *The Green Fog*, an assemblage remake of Hitchcock’s *Vertigo* using footage from a variety of sources (Studio classics, ‘50s noir, and ‘70s prime-time TV), which is also a collaboration with your filmmaking partners Evan Johnson, and Galen Johnson, as well as composer Jacob Garchik, and Kronos Quartet. You have worked with a number of collaborators throughout your career - either as co-writers (George Toles) or directors (Evan and Galen) - could you please speak to how you choose your creative partners?
 
Guy Maddin: Bless you, Antonella, for speaking with me on this occasion. It’s a beautiful night. Where I am the ectoplasm hangs light as cotton candy stalactites around me. Great fluffy banks of ecto-fog tuck me in snugly on either side. I’m in a fluffy haunted canyon and all is good.
 
When I think of my own happy collaborations I think of William T. Wiley and Robert Nelson, of the great spasmodic trance in which they must have made *The Great Blondino*. The film is such a convulsion of spontaneity, I feel they must have have been guided by impulse and confidence. When that feeling envelops a partnership, the time is right to work. That’s the feeling I get working with Galen and Evan, the feeling that flashes of darkness make flashes of light, and there is no longer a gulf between here and there.
 
Antonella Bonfanti: When I was a projectionist at the University of Toronto back in the mid 2000s, a second-year work study student Daniel Neuhaus was working in the booth with me. My colleague Brian Nugent introduced young Daniel to your films and he became so completely enthralled. He was so desperate to learn from you that he contacted you and asked for an internship of sorts. We all thought he was nuts and that certainly “big time” filmmaker Guy Maddin would never accept or even respond. Low and behold you did and Daniel joined you on the set of *My Winnipeg* (2007) for two weeks that March. I love this story, because it taught me two life lessons: 1) don’t be afraid to ask for something, no matter how out of reach it may seem, the worst thing that can happen is you’ll be told “no”, and 2) sometimes talented and accomplished artists are generous people who are excited to share their knowledge and skills. Do you have examples from your own filmmaking history where you were supported by your community and/or the people you looked up to and what that meant?
 
Guy Maddin: Well, I never have been able to say no to anyone, not even now in my current state. That yessing myself to death was a sadness in my life, but at this distance I like to think my weakness created some happiness too, and that by yessing myself to death I opened up the world for myself, both my former world and this one. And of course I was always grateful when other artists were generous with me. The poet John Ashbery has been an important and giving benefactor. The filmmaker George Kuchar was endlessly generous with correspondence and the spirit of his presence, the Brothers Quay were the first filmmakers to take me into their homes and mesmerize me with their example. In each case I was as a quaking boy whenever I was in the company of these titans, and when I was alone again I was always left with the compulsion to make movies.
 
Antonella Bonfanti: The films in this evening’s program are each the product of the singular visions of their makers - all who are liberated from the desire prescribe to “traditional forms of filmmaking” and are actively rejecting mainstream and commercial cinema. How has experimental or avant garde film be an influence to you? Are there any particular films or filmmakers that are of particularly importance?
 
Guy Maddin: The first experimental film I saw was *Castro Street* (1966) by Bruce Baillie. I didn’t even know films like *Castro Street* existed, so that was a lightning bolt moment. Then George Kuchar’s feature *The Devil’s Cleavage* (1975) came along and ripped off my eyelids. I saw this sleazy epic as a young man, then set off far into your realm to seek everything else by this visionary. Marlon Riggs is a pole star in the heavens – I thrill when I think of him. Abigail Child quickens the dead. All of the filmmakers in the programme tonight.
 
Antonella Bonfanti: Absurdity (or absurd comedy) is as a common thread throughout the films in this program, we see this especially in Gary Goldberg’s *Mesmer* (1991) and *The Great Blondino*, this is of course also often an element in your films as well - *The Forbidden Room* (2015) is described as a romantic mystery comedy-drama. Could you talk about comedy in your work?
Guy Maddin: Just as I could never so no, and will never say no so long as there is eternity, I can never take myself seriously. Well, I certainly take myself seriously, I’m doing it right now, but frequently doubts about myself visit, and my footing is shaken a moment. And so I stretch beneath myself great goofy safety nets that might break a fall from my lofty heights if ever I should slip – heaven forbid. And so it came to pass that I had it both ways during my time on earth, that I was serious, yet apparently also risible, a kind of laughing stock. It’s OK, I’ll take a laugh wherever I can get one. It helped that Evan and Galen are extremely funny. Oh how we laughed together while hatching our plots.
 
Antonella Bonfanti: You recently completed a project for the National Film Board of Canada along with your *The Green Fog* collaborators Evan Johnson, and Galen Johnson called *Seance* (2016). It is a web based work described as an indefatigable film generating machine that deliberately creates films only to destroy them after their one and only viewing. This is innovative and experimental media arts project that brings into focus ideas around ephemerality and the fragility of memory. How did this project come to being and can you tell us why it was important for you to make this departure from the traditional cinema or gallery exhibition environments?
 
Guy Maddin: Films have spirits too, and in the case of lost films they’re sad spirits, doomed forever to wander the limbo landscape of cinema history, unable to project themselves for those who might enjoy them. I wanted to create a way for living film lovers to make contact with lost film narrative through Seances, thus the name of our site. Anyone online can summon the spirits of lost films, awaken them for a few moments and invite them to come down and clamour for attention with whoever sits down in front of their screen. The seances are non sequitur-addled, and sad, but they give one a glimpse of what the movie afterlife is like. Cinema is a haunted medium. And from what is lost all is lost again. For a cheery sample please visit our [website](seances.nfb.ca).
 
Antonella Bonfanti: Death, spirits and hauntings are recurring motifs in your movies and Guy, in the 1997 documentary *Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight* directed by Noam Gonick, you say that a cold you got from a cousin resulted in a neurological infection and the permanent, persistent sensation of feeling like you are constantly being touched by ghosts all over your body. Do you feel the presence of spirits now?
 
Guy Maddin: That neurological infection was the best thing that ever came into my body, a lifelong companion that almost never steered me wrong, and that abides with me to this day. It hasn’t yet taught me how to say no, but that’s fine, because in some roundabout way inability brought me to where I am tonight, and, through this guy here, to you in this room, and that’s a good thing. Bless you all and enjoy. A special thank you to William T. Wiley and Robert Nelson’s kids Steven and Oona. Good night. Good night… Good night….

			ephemeraDescription: `### The Damage Done

By **Holly Willis**
 
How long was I angry? Definitely all the way through the ’80s. There were a dozen good reasons why, and at least as many stabs at getting around that anger: drinking, prowling through the night, writing, or trying to write, and generally making a mess of things. It took a spate of films and videos by women to loosen things up, to make me even begin to feel something like whole again. Films by Su Friedrich and Barbara Hammer, videos by Joan Jonas, Lynn Hershman, and, a little later, Sadie Benning. And it was not simply stories by women for women. It was the way they were made, the scratching, scraping, scarring. The wrenching, the cutting and re-cutting, the stealing, pirating, pillaging.
 
It was the violence enacted on the medium itself that I loved.
 
Rather than fetishizing the polish of Hollywood or emulating the high sheen of video art’s mostly male canon, these works literally trash the medium they were composed within, scratching emulsion, distorting the image, wrecking the sound. Not interested in the intellectual juxtapositions of so much of the collage and montage of a broader avant-garde heritage, this work is adamantly political, fashioning scruffy, defiantly bedraggled imagery into biting commentary in and through a literal destruction and mangling of the moving image. Scratch, rip, destroy!
 
Take Naomi Uman’s short film *Removed* (1999). The filmmaker appropriated several sections of a 1970s porn film with a patently ridiculous plot: two couples fool around in two hotel rooms, which are connected by a two-way mirror. In room one, the man and woman argue, undress and have sex. In room two, the man narrates the action happening next door for his partner while pawing at her body. She twists and turns and, through gasps, asks for more details. “She’s studying her body,” her partner drolly reports, and indeed she is. And so are a bunch of us. Or we are trying to.
 
You see, Uman applied acetone to the emulsion, working frame by frame to etch out the writhing bodies of every woman in the film. All that remains are moaning white splotches. On occasion, there’s the flash of a nipple or an expression on a face where the bleach or nail polish missed their mark, but rather than titillating, the revelation underscores the flatness of the original, its utter banality. In contrast, the wiggly amorphous shapes shiver and shimmy defiantly, and we regard with gleeful satisfaction the damage done.
 
In *Removed*, we also contemplate Uman’s physical labor. It is impossible not to imagine her hands painstakingly doing their work, tangibly changing the texture and chemical composition of the image. Frame by frame, erasing, dissolving away the body. In her hands, the bleach becomes an unlikely salve for an enduring anger.
 
In a similar vein, JoAnn Elam inflicts her own kind of damage upon a piece of footage, making it vibrate with an uncomfortable flicker. Her film *Lie Back and Enjoy It* (1982) pairs a conversation on the soundtrack between a man and a woman discussing gender and power with black-and-white images of a woman’s face, shot from just slightly above. She looks sexy. There’s something going on, but you’re not quite sure what. In the verbal exchange, the woman argues, “You are trying to establish a power relationship here by filming and taping me,” and meanwhile, we watch the other woman onscreen, very much an object within a power dynamic. She performs a sense of pleasure, smiling coyly. In the audio conversation, the man objects to his partner’s accusation, explaining that he is merely trying to get to the truth. “I have a camera and you don’t,” he says matter-of-factly, and it is as if this simple truth is enough to stop the conversation.
 
It does not stop the conversation, however. Elam lets the arguing pair bounce back and forth as they try to parse how power is embedded in the image while we see evidence of that power through the way the woman onscreen is framed. Elam messes with the image, using a strobing effect, inserting intriguing intertitles and showing sprocket holes. There is no way to forget that we are watching a film as it becomes nearly uncomfortable to focus on the woman’s face through the flashing. And yet the power of the imagery is tremendous, and the pleasure in seeing her is unmistakable. Like *Removed*, this is a brilliant project that makes its point through a violent dismantling and disruption.
 
Rather than marring the emulsion or stuttering her images, Betzy Bromberg’s tactic in her 1978 film *Ciao Bella* is to fold things together, blending the act of filmmaking and the body such that the film becomes a means for knowing who you are in the work that you create. The film is set in the streets and interior spaces of 1970s New York, and Bromberg juxtaposes snippets of childish energy and the provocation of nearly naked women. She deftly contrasts vibrant exuberance with a sense of devastating loss, and the effect is at once brazenly personal and deeply political. One of the final shots of *Ciao Bella* is of a jubilant topless dancer caught in a reddish flare and sprocket holes; the picture merges the woman’s vivacious energy with film as a medium, and this is a perfect emblem for Bromberg’s work, which so often attends to the specific beauty and potential of film.
 
If folding names Bromberg’s tactic, for Abigail Child it’s collision that perhaps best describes her approach in the film *Mercy* (1989). While reminiscent of Bruce Conner’s *A Movie* (1958) in the sweep of found footage images that bang and clash, Child’s film goes straight for the body. Kneading hands, pulsing biceps, bare breasts, coiffed hair: you can feel these bodies. At the same time, the bodies are forced into highly coded cultural practices – wrestling, taking pictures, waterskiing, marching in parades – or they try to find a way to be at home in curiously regimented spaces, such as the assembly line and amusement park. The bodies reckon with regimes of authority, even if these are conspicuously ridiculous enactments of that authority.
 
With her 1992 film *Chronicles of a Lying Spirit (by Kelly Gabron)*, filmmaker Cauleen Smith similarly skewers authority with an unorthodox autobiographical collage driven by an almost incantatory voice describing life events that cannot possibly pertain to a single person. In this way, the film cheerfully disrupts the unified self of Western philosophy, replacing the “I” with a chorus of voices and a collage of cut-out imagery and type-written texts. Together, these fragments of many lives weave a biography in flux across time and, perhaps most significantly, in relation to those who have come before the narrator, refusing clarity and coherence in favor of layering, doubling and mutability. It’s a struggle to keep up with the panoply of voices here, to make sense, to suss out the truth in the midst of the contradictions, and that’s the point: this is the celebratory and iconoclastic chronicle of a lying spirit.
 
Lying may or may not be an element in Greta Snider’s black-and-white short film *Portland* (1996), which tells the story of a group of friends who travel to Portland, Oregon, and endure a series of misadventures. It rains. They’re hungry. Their stuff gets locked up. One of them gets arrested and put on a work crew. Worst of all, a trip dedicated to drinking and partying includes no drinking or partying. The film is funny and raucous, with a kick-ass soundtrack. But what makes it for me is what I love about Snider’s work in general: an unlikely lyricism seeps through here and there. The camera swings out over the railway tracks, for example, and the lines slip into pure form for a moment. Or a door opens, blasting light and blowing the image into abstraction, a dazzle of glistening grey shapes. Or even just the narrow passage between two train cars, when the vertical and horizontal lines and the dark planes of each panel become momentarily a lovely composition in spite of the frenzy. These moments pop up in the midst of the general chaos wrought by a camera moving unapologetically with a body that’s relentlessly roaming around to see what’s what. There is no hallowed respect for the steadiness of proper cinema, and the framing is careless in the best sense. This is irreverence embodied, and that fierce defiance makes my heart sing.
 
The material destruction enacted by these artists shuffles notions of aesthetic value, refusing the hierarchy of polish. Better than that, the damage done to the image and sound is visceral. Each scratch, each blur, each flicker: we feel it and it feels damn good.
